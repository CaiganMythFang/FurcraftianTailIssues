UPDATE OVERVIEW
BEFORE UPDATING TO THIS RELEASE, PLEASE DO THE FOLLOWING : 
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE BACKUPS! Multiple mods make downgrading to a previous FOGCraft Goes West version impossible due to changes.
Empty all Corail Recycler inventories. (Block resets)
Move all items you want to keep out of your Aroma1997 Mining Dimension. (Dimension resets)
Finish any Better Questing OSS block progress (Block resets)

Consider Random PSIDeas


Back after a bit of a health related break (heart surgery, yikes...) and quite a busy real life shift.

A lot of mods are updated to fix various bugs and issues. Some quests are updated, and some new stuff is in the works! 

NEW MODS

RATS

RETURNING MODS

Chisels and Bits
Certain changes to VanillaFix were split off to their own mod, which no longer causes issues with Chisels and Bits. So its back!

Conflicted with Rats, which contains more interesting Rats.
